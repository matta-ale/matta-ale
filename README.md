⭐️ From matta-ale

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Alexis. 
With over 15 years of experience in Supply Chain as an industrial engineer, I am determined to make a career shift and dive into the world of Full Stack web development. My interest in finance, which led me to pursue a master's degree in the field, has provided me with a deep understanding of financial aspects that can be valuable in the development of Fintech applications. Furthermore, my experience in Supply Chain allows me to comprehend the needs of clients in this sector and contribute to technological solutions that enhance their efficiency and productivity.

I got into coding while attempting to build trading bots—automated algorithms that operate in stock markets with real money through Broker APIs. I began learning Python (self-taught) to accomplish this goal, which I successfully achieved. Soon, I realized that I enjoyed the entire process, not only designing the financial strategy but also the coding aspect of it—creating an application that functions smoothly without bugs. The idea of turning this passion into a career started to take root, and I eventually decided to study web development.

Currently, I am completing a specialized Full Stack Development bootcamp and working on projects to expand my portfolio. I have strong skills in JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL.

😍 What i like to do:
